 - A React/Typescript frontent styled using MUI and served on localhost

 - Colors are fetched and patched using Axios, and the server data is updated using ReactQuery hooks like useQuery and useMutation.   
   
 ### After downloading the files, install package dependencies using yarn (yarn install) and run both servers from the parent directory with (yarn start).
